Cat API - code challenge for job application

INSTRUCTIONS
1.) Sign up and create an API key at https://thecatapi.com/

2.) Create an app that retrieves some data from one of the cat API endpoints (of your choice) and renders it on a web page. (Be creative!) You can use language/framework that you are most comfortable with.

3.) Send us a link to a git repo where we can view the code you've written. The root folder of the repo should contain a screenshot showing your app rendering the cat data.

NOTES
I used vanilla JavaScript for this project. I wanted to use React but because of the lack of time I decided not to. For the animation I used GSAP => https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger It was a fun little project to work on
